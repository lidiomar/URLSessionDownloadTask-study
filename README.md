# URLSessionDownloadTask-study

This is a simple example of a PDF downloader app.

In this example, the PDF file can be downloaded and saved in cache, so the network request is not done twice.

The file used as an example is available at https://www.learningcontainer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/sample-pdf-download-10-mb.pdf.

It is done using URLSession, URLSessionDownloadTask, and URLSessionDownloadDelegate to control the loading indicator presentation.

The interface was created with SwiftUI.
